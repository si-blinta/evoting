Problem:
Any one can forge a new commit by taking the sequence number and the signed sequence number and put it on old commit.
Solution: add the sequence number to the commit hash => (C|S|seq)
when verifiying:
check if H(C|S|seq) == seq 
ou peut etre une seule signature qui regroupe tout ! 



Add elligbility state: DO not allow commits
Add commit state: Do not allow elligibility requests
add Counting state: Do not accept any requests (ENDED state) show results on builtin board, allow users to get the csv for example .

Remove the blinding factor from the wallet !
